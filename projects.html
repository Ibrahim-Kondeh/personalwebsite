          - Problem-Solving: Addressing the challenge of transitioning from manual data tracking to a digital system, aiming to optimize inventory management and customer relations.<br>
          - Collaboration: Engaging in effective teamwork to ensure the database met the multifaceted needs of the La Cocina de la Abuela Taco Truck.</p>
          <p><strong>Human Skills Gained:</strong><br>
          Working within a group setting provided an invaluable opportunity to enhance interpersonal skills. Collaborating with diverse team members from different backgrounds and skill sets heightened my adaptability and communication skills. Effective communication and the ability to understand varying perspectives were pivotal in reconciling differing ideas and ensuring the project's success.</p>
          <p>This project not only allowed for the practical application of MIS knowledge but also emphasized the significance of effective teamwork and adaptability in resolving real-world business challenges.</p>
