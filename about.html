          <h2>Personal Information</h2>
          <p class="lead">I am Ibrahim Kondeh, a junior student at the Michael F. Price College of Business, pursuing majors in Management Information Systems (MIS) and Accounting. As an international student, I have a deep appreciation for intercultural understanding, derived from attending an international high school with classmates representing over 95 countries. Having explored 18 countries, my passion for travel has amplified this value.</p>
          <p>I am enthusiastic about leveraging my knowledge in MIS, including databases, SQL, and C#, along with my expertise in accounting, to provide innovative solutions to complex business challenges. Moreover, I actively utilize my time management, public speaking, and leadership skills to catalyze positive change within the communities I reside in.</p>
